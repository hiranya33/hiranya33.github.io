title: MTA Subway Traffic -Exploratory Data Analysis!
published: true
---

## Challenge
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is a charitable organization that has an Annual Gala at the beginning of Summer every year. We were tasked to use exploratory data analysis to determine the very best subway locations to optimize the placemnet of their street team in order to spread awareness and fill the gala with people who are passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology and contribute to the cause.

## Data
We used the MTA Turnstile Data which provides a detailed record count of every person who entered or exited through a New York MTA turnstile [MTA data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). We looked at data from 4 weeks  between 19th May & 16th June of 2018 because the Gala is held in early summer every year. Google API was used to get the zipcodes for the subway stations and the income data for wealthy residents by zipcode  was gathered from US Census data for the year 2016.



## Methodology
We focussed on a three pronged approach to find the target subway stations.

1. **Median Daily Traffic**
   
   Stations with highest median daily traffic should be considered so that the Street Team can reach as many people 
as possible to cast a wider net for prospective donors.
2. **Commuter vs Non-Commuter**
   
   Stations that are busier during the weedays rather than weekends were considered as commuter traffic. A metric  
   weekday/weekend ratio was calculated to asses if a station was commuter or a non commuter station. This is important
   because we want to target local New York residents who would be able to attend the gala as opposed to tourits.
3. **High Income**
   
   High income New Yorkers are much more attractive targets for the organization as they are likely in a better place to
   donate. Subway stations located in areas with more wealthy people are more likely to have wealthy people entering or
   exiting. We identified the count of residents in a zipcode with income over $100,000  as high income group.

The intersection of these three criterias formed our group of target subway stations.

## Analysis

We gatheed the zip codes for the unique MTA stations using  google maps library and Google API in python.A list of unique addresses for the staions returned the corresponding zipcode.The zipcodes and staions were stored in a csv file .
The next step was to parse the US census data to narrow down the list of possible zip codes in New York City. The resulting data frame was merged with the MTA turnstiles dataframe to get a composite data with income data, zipcodes and turnstile data.
The resulting data frame was then sorted by the median total traffic for each station on a daily basis.Count of high income residents with annual income > $100k were filtered for count>8000 (1 std dev from mean) and commuter stations were then chosen by calculating a weekday to weekend ratio of median daily traffic. If the ratio was  greater than 1 std. deviation  from mean (ratio, 2 in our case) then it was classified as a commuter station

## Results

Our recommendation is to send the Street Teams to these 5 stations, which represent the greatest opportunity for the street team. Three of those are located in Manhattan which is known to have a concentration of wealthy people and high traffic .The remaining two were located in Brooklyn

Subway sations were first filtered by comuuter vs non commuter stations based on weekday/weekend ratio .Final stations were then filtered by count of high income residents .Figure showing the same


   
We recommend targeting commuters during the peak transit times highlighted in dark red , on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in particular, when total trafiic is highest.Heat map of total traffic in a 4h daily basis vs day of week. This approch helps in targeting stations a different times.

## Future Work
These are the areas worth exploring in future:
 
1. Drill down further on income data, on a block by block basis 
2. Compute a “Tech Score” to determine tech companies close to subway stations. Narrow down on traget by assigning a weighted
   score tech score ,income and commuter statioins.
3. Calculate the net inflow/outflow of commuters from any given station at tunstile level to accurately place the street team 
   near a particular turnstile location
