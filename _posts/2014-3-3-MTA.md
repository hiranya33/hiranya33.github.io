title: MTA Subway Traffic -Exploratory Data Analysis!
published: true
---

## The Challenge
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is a charitable organization that has an Annual Gala at the beginning of Summer every year. We were tasked to use exploratory data analysis to determine the very best subway locations to optimize the placemnet of their street team in order to spread awareness and fill the gala with people who are passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology and contribute to the cause.

## The Data
We used the MTA Turnstile Data which provides a detailed record count of every person who entered or exited through a New York MTA turnstile [MTA data](rom: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).We looked at data from 4 weeks  between 19th May & 16th June of 2018 because the Gala is held in early summer every year. Google API was used to get the zipcodes for the subway stations and the income data for wealthy residents by zipcode  was gathered from US Census data for the year 2016.

## The Methodology
We focussed on a three pronged approach to find the target subway stations.
1.**Median Daily Traffic**
⋅⋅⋅Stations with highest median daily traffic should be considered so that the Street Team can reach as many people as possible.⋅⋅⋅
2.**Commutersc**
⋅⋅⋅Stations that are busier during the weedays rather than weekends were considered as commuter traffic. A metric weekday/weekend ratio was calculated to asses if a station was commuter or a non commuter station. This is important because we want to target local New York residents who would be able to attend the gala as opposed to tourits.
