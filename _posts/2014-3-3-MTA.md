title: MTA Subway Traffic -Exploratory Data Analysis!
published: true
---

## Challenge
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is a charitable organization that has an Annual Gala at the beginning of Summer every year. We were tasked to use exploratory data analysis to determine the very best subway locations to optimize the placemnet of their street team in order to spread awareness and fill the gala with people who are passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology and contribute to the cause.

## Data
We used the MTA Turnstile Data which provides a detailed record count of every person who entered or exited through a New York MTA turnstile [MTA data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). We looked at data from 4 weeks  between 19th May & 16th June of 2018 because the Gala is held in early summer every year. Google API was used to get the zipcodes for the subway stations and the income data for wealthy residents by zipcode  was gathered from US Census data for the year 2016.

## Methodology
We focussed on a three pronged approach to find the target subway stations.

1. **Median Daily Traffic**
   
   Stations with highest median daily traffic should be considered so that the Street Team can reach as many people as                      
   possible to cast a wider net for prospective donors.
2. **Commuter vs Non-Commuter**
   
   Stations that are busier during the weedays rather than weekends were considered as commuter traffic. A metric  
   weekday/weekend ratio was calculated to asses if a station was commuter or a non commuter station. This is important
   because we want to target local New York residents who would be able to attend the gala as opposed to tourits.
3. **High Income**
   
   High income New Yorkers are much more attractive targets for the organization as they are likely in a better place to
   donate. Subway stations located in areas with more wealthy people are more likely to have wealthy people entering or
   exiting. We identified the count of residents in a zipcode with income over $100,000  as high income group.

The intersection of these three criterias formed our group of target subway stations.

## Results

We recommend sending Street Teams to these 5 stations, which represent the greatest opportunity for the street team given 
We recommend targeting Commuters during the busy transit times, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in particular, when volumes at the best stations with our target donors will be the highest.

We have also provided our client with detailed daily and hourly Heatmaps for each recommended subway station, so that they can further customize the timing of street team deployments to each individual station.
   
## Conclusions

Charity outreach is a game of numbers. Deploying street teams to the subway stations with the highest ridership is a no-brainer.
Still, beyond stations with the largest numbers, it’s important that we deploy the street teams in the smartest way possible, so that they have the greatest chance of converting a Subway rider into a Gala Attendee, and eventually into a Donor.
Our analysis of the ridership of different locations led to a surprising result (!).
The stations with the greatest ridership were not necessarily the ones that had the greatest number of people with income over $100k.
Although our analysis is imperfect because it accounts only for the number of people near each station who make over $100k (as opposed to looking at the average wealth per household in area), we’d argue that our measure of wealth more accurately reflects what the street team is looking for - a large number of people who have the means to donate - rather than a small number of people with great wealth.


## Future Work
These are the areas worth exploring in future:
 
1. Drill down further on income data, on a block by block basis 
2. Compute a “Tech Score” to determine which areas are particularly close to tech companies 
Investigate whether commuters from outside the city, who hold well-paying jobs within the city, would be good targets for our campaign, or not.
Look into the net inflow/outflow of commuters from any given station at a given time. Knowing that information, we could infer the direction of commuters’ travel.
Fulton Street Station had a particularly pronounced surge in riders around 12 PM (noon) every weekday. With some further exploratory data analysis, we could look into why that surge occurs, and whether this would be a good time of day for the Street Team to take advantage of.
